Bankers Algorithm Simulation
To build program, type 'go build'
to run program, type './Banker "file.txt" ' 
This Program simulates the Bankers Algorithm, for detecting a safe state in a system.
The program reads in a file, formatted to the specifications provided in lab hand out.
The file should in the n and m, available vector, resource vector, max matrix,
allocation max and request vector. The program will generate the need matrix,
determine if system is in safe state, and if request can be allocated.
